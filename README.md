## Overview

**Project Title**:
Music Playlist Manager
**Project Description**:
This software allows users to create, manage, and share music playlists. The song information such as title, artist, album, and duration is stored in a MongoDB database. Users can create multiple playlists, add or remove songs, and view their playlist details.
**Project Goals**:
    1:Create a local database to store playlists and song information.
    2:Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on playlists and songs.
    3:Provide a command-line interface for users to interact with the application.
## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install MONGODB and set it up 
2. Install libraries because we use pymongo
3.R un the program

Instructions for using the software:

1. Launch the Python script using the command python playlist_manager.py.
2. Follow the interactive prompts to create, view, update, and delete playlists and songs.
3. To add songs to a playlist, youâ€™ll first need to create a playlist. Then, you can add songs by entering their details.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio
* MongoDB - Database used for storing playlist and song data.
* pymongo - Python library for interacting with MongoDB

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Mongo Documantatio](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
* [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)


## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user experience.
* [ ] Add functionality to stream songs from a music API (like Spotify) instead of manual song details.
* [ ] Add unit tests for functions to ensure better code quality and performance.
